%%%%

book of the tundra

A book written by peoples of a cold and inhospitable realm. It's exceptionally

usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a large radius, which will then shrink, eventually
covering only the reader, before it times out.

A small chunk of dense but otherwise unremarkable natural mineral. It can be
thrown to cause minor damage.

tower shield

attack speed of the wearer. These penalties will be reduced and eventually
eliminated with increased Shields skill.
%%%%
tin of tremorstones

A set of dormant, magnetic earth elementals in the form of tiny, very heavy
pebbles. When released, the elementals are drawn magnetically to the center of
nearby monsters, where they literally explode with rage at their rest being
disturbed. Tremorstones usually land slightly off-target, and the user is
always at risk of being hit. However, armour is extremely effective at
repelling the lightweight fragments of rock from a tremorstone's explosion, so
a well-armoured wielder has little to fear. Evocations skill increases the
number of explosions.
