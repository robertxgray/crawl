vertigo briefly if they successfully make contact with other minds. It is
frequently used as an icebreaker at wizard parties.
%%%%
Anguish spell

Afflicts nearby foes with supernatural anguish, causing all damage they deal to
rebound on them for the duration of the effect. Strong-willed foes can resist the
necromantic visions of pain and suffering, and mindless creatures are unaffected.

slowly, but draws strength from the inherent protection of your own armour. At
higher power, the spirit becomes more durable.
%%%%

increase with spell power. Re-casting this spell will return zombies to dust, as

Apportation spell

Pulls the top item or group of similar items from a distant pile to the floor

%%%%
Borgnjor's Revivification spell

Instantly heals any and all wounds suffered by the caster, but also permanently

will briefly paralyse the caster. It has no effect on the undead.

Enemies caught in the area will be held in place and constricted until they

by any means of protection, such as armour or resistances. However, certain
creatures, usually those able to invoke damnation themselves, are entirely
unscathed by damnation.
%%%%
Call Down Lightning spell

Blasts a targeted enemy with lightning, with no direct line of fire required.
The targeting magics need distance to function, so enemies that are adjacent
or nearly adjacent cannot be struck by this.
%%%%
Call Imp spell

Calls forth a minor demon from the pits of Hell. The demon will fight
alongside the caster for a time depending on spell power.
%%%%

powerful undead to bring them back from brink of demise, or turn dying living
creatures into spectral versions of themselves.
%%%%

might, agility, or improved resistances. The chaotic magic may occasionally
backfire and cause allies to instead lose their willpower or be berserked,
polymorphed, or filled with inner flame.
%%%%
Call Tide spell

distance. Soon after calling it, the waters on the whole level will reach high
tide. Waters near the caster will reach even higher levels than they would

morale. They have no noticeable effect.

effects. The arc can touch upon the caster without harming them.

Induces a state of bewilderment and confusion in a creature's mind, with no
direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Conjure Ball Lightning spell

Creates a pack of ball lightnings, which seek out the nearest enemy before
exploding in a huge blast of electricity. Casters are advised to use caution;
the lightning is not mindful of what it may hit.

The magic which keeps ball lightnings cohesive has limited range, so they may
dissipate harmlessly if allowed to drift too far away from their caster before
exploding.
%%%%
Conjure Flame spell

Conjures burning embers at the caster's feet, which will burst into flame soon
after. Any creature (including the caster) that stands on the embers will smother
them, so casters are well advised to step away immediately after casting.
Re-casting the spell will also ignite the embers, burning the caster.
%%%%
Conjure Living Spells spell

Creates several living, autonomous spells, which cast themselves at the first foe
to enter their range. Once cast, they dissipate.
%%%%
Corona spell

Causes a halo of glowing light to surround and effectively outline a creature.
This glow offsets the dark, musty atmosphere of the dungeon, and makes the
affected creature appreciably easier to hit.
%%%%
Corpse Rot spell

Rapidly accelerates the decomposition of living monsters slain by the caster,
and gathers the foul miasmic vapour around the caster. The clouds eat away at
the life force of any creature they envelop.
%%%%
Corrosive Bolt spell

Fires a penetrating bolt of acid.
%%%%

Unleashes Abyssal energies in the immediate vicinity. This changes the
appearance of the affected area and temporarily summons creatures from the

bodies in an adverse fashion. It cannot affect artificial beings, and the

enemies of the caster standing next to that terrain will be frozen and will find
their movements slowed.

randomly imbued with either fire or ice, and additionally will reflect from
walls of any material due to the crystal embedded in the shot.
%%%%

The caster erupts in a scintillating display of light. Any living creature
nearby may be dazzled and left stumbling blindly.
%%%%
Death Channel spell

Binds the souls of slain living, demonic and holy creatures, forcing their
spectres to remain and fight for the caster for as long as the channel lasts.
%%%%
Death Rattle spell

Exhales the essence of the dying, creating clouds of noxious miasma.
%%%%
Death's Door spell

Renders the caster nigh invulnerable to harm for a brief period, but brings
them dangerously close to death in the process. So close, in fact, that the
body believes itself to be dead — healing effects will do nothing.

The caster will receive one warning shortly before the spell expires. After
expiry, the spell cannot immediately be recast, but with high power the caster
will be left further from death when the effect ends. It has no effect on those
who are already undead.
%%%%

%%%%

Drives nearby creatures into an insane frenzy, causing them to mercilessly
attack anything and everything nearby with great strength and speed.
%%%%
Disjunction spell

Destabilizes the space in a sphere around the caster for a while, causing
anyone nearby to blink away from the caster. The chance of blinking depends on
the distance from the caster, being nearly certain when directly adjacent. It
causes magical contamination when cast.
%%%%
Dispel Undead spell

Harms an adjacent undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces
binding it together.
%%%%
Dispel Undead Range spell

Harms an undead creature greatly by interfering with the forces binding it
together.
%%%%
Dispersal spell

creature with the Will to resist will still be irresistibly blinked a shorter
distance, and any monster it affects at all has a separate Will-based chance
of being confused by the warping of space.
%%%%
Doom Howl spell

Unleashes a piercing howl that catches and echoes in victims' minds. While
those echoes linger, nightmarish creatures will hear and track them to their
source. It can only be used once by a given creature.

they become much more robust, although their evasiveness is reduced.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.
%%%%
Dragon's Call spell

Issues a powerful call to a draconic realm, beckoning forth dragon after dragon
to engage the summoner's enemies. The spell is taxing to maintain, and each new
dragon which answers the call will further drain the summoner's magical
reserves. After the call ends, it cannot be issued again for a short time. The
duration of the call and the species of dragons called depend on spell power.
%%%%
Drain Life spell

Eringya's Noxious Bog spell

Causes the caster to release a torrent of sludge that transforms nearby areas
into a toxic bog. The sludge damages and poisons all monsters, even those
resistant to poison. The bog cannot form on areas adjacent to multiple solid

transformation is temporary and cannot be sustained out of the caster's sight.
Spellpower will increase how long the bog lingers.
%%%%
Eruption spell

Splits the earth to draw up a localized, short-lived volcano under the target.

Fireball spell

Hurls an explosive ball of fire.

%%%%
Flash Freeze spell

Freezes the air around a target, causing significant harm and slowing the

rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. They will dissipate harmlessly

target may have. This may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.
%%%%
Freezing Cloud spell

Conjures up a large cloud of lethally cold vapour.
%%%%

Encases surrounding walls with ice for a short time. Foes that wander near the
icy walls will be damaged, and this may temporarily slow cold-blooded creatures.

short duration. The prism is extremely fragile and any damage caused to it may
result in premature detonation.

it engulfs.
%%%%

Throws a nearby ally at the monster's foe, doing minimal damage and landing the
thrown monster nearby.
%%%%
Glaciate spell

Conjures forth a mighty blast of ice. Creatures within its cone-shaped area of

portion of its damage bypasses cold resistance.

victim. The roots will retreat if the victim breaks free or if the caller moves
out of view.
%%%%
Greater Servant of Makhleb spell

gods. These flames are especially dangerous to undead and demonic creatures,

dangerous to undead and demonic creatures, and have no effect on holy
creatures.
%%%%
Iceblast spell

Fires a large mass of ice, which explodes on impact. It affects even
cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Ice Form spell

Transforms the caster into a frozen ice-creature, light enough to float on

resistant to cold and resistant to poison, but vulnerable to fire.
High power increases the armour granted by this form.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.
%%%%
Ignite Poison spell

Converts all nearby poison into liquid flame, burning poisoned creatures from
within. It also turns clouds of poison and mephitic gases into flame. The

Turns a nearby ally invisible.
%%%%
Iron Shot spell

Hurls a large and heavy metal shot.
%%%%
Irradiate spell

Transmutes an ultra-thin layer of the caster's skin (or equivalent) directly
into pure magical energy, blasting adjacent creatures. It heavily deforms
its targets, weakening them and reducing their armour. The caster is not left
entirely unaffected; some of the magic lingers, enough to leave them
dangerously contaminated after a few castings.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Battlesphere spell

Conjures a small globe of magical energy. Each time its creator casts a
spell from the Conjuration school (other than Battlesphere itself or Spellforged
Servitor), the battlesphere will launch its own volley of energy at a random
foe. With increasing power, the battlesphere lasts longer and deals more damage
per volley.
%%%%
Iskenderun's Mystic Blast spell

Detonates a crackling sphere of destructive energy. The explosion will hit all
nearby monsters with physical force, knocking them back if damage is done.
%%%%
Leda's Liquefaction spell

Liquefies the ground around the caster, making it difficult to move through.
Any movement through liquefied ground will be slowed, and creatures stuck in
the liquefied ground will be unable to fly. Attempts to attack the caster
in melee may fail.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out. Maintaining the
connection to the ground slows the caster's movement, even if they are flying.
%%%%
Lee's Rapid Deconstruction spell

Fragments a wall or a suitably brittle visible monster into an explosion of
deadly shrapnel. It can be used on monsters made of ice, bone, or any wall-like
substance, as well as those turned to stone by petrification. Its damage is

be any mix of Fireball, Iceblast, and Ghostly Fireball.

%%%%

unknown, tainted otherworld. It requires open space to succeed. After a short
time, a powerful clawed tentacle will reach through the portal, remaining bound
to the caster's will for a duration depending on power. With the portal's
expiry, the tentacle will be severed and turn on the caster. The duration of
the portal increases with spell power.
%%%%
Malign Offering spell

Drains life from an enemy, healing nearby allies in the process.

Bestows a mutation on a target. The mutation is almost always harmful. It
cannot affect artificial beings, and the undead will decompose if affected.

targets with one melee attack. The effect is too imprecise to allow stabbing
unsuspecting foes. At high power, it can be used to strike more enemies at
once.
%%%%
Mara Summon spell

Weaves illusions of the caster. Such illusions have the same physical prowess
as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
Marshlight spell

Conjures two balls of burning swamp gas adjacent to the caster. The balls will
rapidly seek the nearest monster and burn them. Wizards attempted to copy this
with the spell 'Foxfire', but their version is much less powerful.
%%%%
Mass Confusion spell

Causes confusion in all who gaze upon the caster.
%%%%
Maxwell's Capacitive Coupling spell

Gradually builds up electric charge in the caster, so long as they maintain
focus (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions). When a threshold
is reached, the charge couples with the nearest foe, vaporising them instantly.
Higher spell power will allow the caster to accumulate charge more rapidly.
%%%%
Mephitic Cloud spell

Conjures up a short-lived cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion in
any creature not resistant to poison. Tougher, more experienced creatures are
less likely to be affected.
%%%%
Mesmerise spell

Makes a targeted creature unwilling to move away from the caster. Leaving the
caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Metabolic Englaciation spell

Lowers the metabolic rate of every creature in the caster's vicinity, slowing
all those who are not resistant to cold. Cold-blooded creatures will be
affected much more strongly, and tougher creatures will be slowed for a
shorter time.
%%%%
Metal Splinters spell

Fires a directed stream of sharp metal splinters. Its damage is strongly
reduced by armour.
%%%%
Miasma Breath spell

Creates a large cloud of foul pestilence, poisoning and sometimes slowing any
living creatures it touches.
%%%%
Might Other spell

Significantly increases a nearby ally's damage dealt in melee.
%%%%
Might spell

Significantly increases the caster's damage in melee.
%%%%
Mindburst spell

Launches a psychic attack. If it overcomes the victim's willpower, it
'blows their mind' in a violently literal fashion, dealing damage that
bypasses their armour entirely. It is useless against mindless creatures.
%%%%
Minor Healing spell

Heals a small amount of damage to the caster's body.
%%%%
Monstrous Menagerie spell

Summons a powerful exotic creature to the caster's aid: a manticore, a lindwurm,
or, at high power, even a sphinx. Casting the spell at higher power also
increases the strength of the beasts themselves.
%%%%
Necromutation spell

Transforms the caster into a lich — a powerful skeletal figure. The caster
becomes stronger-willed, more resistant to cold and completely immune to
poison, miasma, negative energy, and torment for the duration of the spell.
The caster's necromancy spells are increased in power, and they gain a draining
melee attack. The caster also gains some of the more dubious benefits of having
an undead body, such as a vulnerability to holy damage and Dispel Undead, and
an inability to consume potions.
%%%%
Necrotise spell

Agonizingly rots away the victim's flesh. Those slain by this spell (or otherwise
dying immediately afterward) may rise as skeletons to fight for the caster. Only
the living can be affected.
%%%%
Noxious Cloud spell

Creates a large cloud of noxious fumes, which may cause confusion.
%%%%
Olgreb's Toxic Radiance spell

Causes the caster to radiate toxic energy, continuously inflicting poison on
everything in line of sight for as long as the spell lasts.
%%%%
Orb of Destruction spell

Conjures an orb made of pure destructive magic. Compared to most other
projectiles, these orbs travel at a relatively slow pace. The orbs home onto
their targets, yet because of their huge inertia, especially agile opponents
may be able to outmanoeuvre them. The orbs need some time to stabilize, and a
nascent orb will deal reduced damage.

Residents of the dungeon are able to maintain the orb until it impacts a
target, but when cast by you the orb will dissipate upon leaving your line of
sight.
%%%%
Orb of Electricity spell

Hurls a crackling orb of electrical energy, creating a huge explosion on
impact. Its damage partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Armour spell

Envelops the caster's body in a protective layer of thick ice, granting a
substantial bonus to armour as long as they remain in their current location.
The ice will crack and fall away if the caster moves to a new position. The
spell decreases in effectiveness in heavier armour, granting a lower bonus the
higher the encumbrance rating of the caster's armour.
%%%%
Ozocubu's Refrigeration spell

Turns the air bitterly cold, freezing all other creatures in line of sight.
This is less effective against creatures packed tightly together - those
adjacent to others will be partly insulated from the cold, taking less damage.
%%%%
Pain spell

Inflicts an extremely painful injury upon one living creature. The caster
suffers minor damage from the backlash.
%%%%
Paralyse spell

Prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time.
%%%%
Paralysis Gaze spell

Irresistably prevents a creature from taking any action for a short time,
requiring multiple charges but not line of fire.
%%%%
Passage of Golubria spell

Opens two gateways (one always near the caster), which allow instantaneous
transport to random other open gateways to any creature entering them. There is
no limit to the number of gateways that can be open at one time, but a gateway
will close when entered, or after a moderate amount of time.
%%%%
Passwall spell

Tunes the caster's body such that it can instantly pass through solid rock.
It takes some time for the caster to attune to the rock, during which they will
be helpless.
%%%%
Petrify spell

Petrifies a targeted creature. If successful, the target is slowed down for a
while until it is temporarily turned into stone. In this state, the target will
take less damage upon being hit.
%%%%
Petrifying Cloud spell

Exhales calcifying dust, which petrifies anyone affected for longer than a
brief moment.
%%%%
Phantom Mirror spell

Creates a phantom copy of a creature. The copy will be somewhat fragile, but
otherwise almost indistinguishable from the original.
%%%%
Plane Rend spell

Summons some of the greater threats from one of the Pits of Slime, the Elven
Halls, the Vaults, the Crypt, the Tomb of Ancients, or the Realm of Zot; the
specific branch varies with each cast of the spell.
%%%%
Poison Arrow spell

Fires a magical arrow coated with the most vile and noxious toxin. Even those
resistant to poison will be poisoned by it, and a small portion of its direct
damage bypasses poison resistance.
%%%%
Poisonous Cloud spell

Conjures forth a great cloud of lethal gases.
%%%%
Poisonous Vapours spell

Turns the air around a targeted creature toxic, directly inflicting poison on
the target before dispersing.
%%%%
Polar Vortex spell

Turns the air around the caster into a freezing vortex, doing tremendous damage
to everyone caught in it that can only partially be mitigated by resistance to
cold. Those affected will also be swept up into the air and tossed around.
Only the eye of the storm is a safe place, and it follows the caster. The
vortex is unable to follow the caster through long-distance translocations.
The spell's effectiveness is greatly diminished in closed areas. After the
vortex fades, it cannot be called forth again for a short time.
%%%%
Polymorph spell

Randomly alters the form of a creature. It is especially effective against
shape-changing creatures.
%%%%
Porkalator spell

Transforms the target into a pig. The target moves swiftly but cannot cast
spells. The caster's demise will cause the transformation to end.
%%%%
Portal Projectile spell

Allows the caster to teleport fired or thrown missiles directly to their
targets for a short duration, spending an additional small amount of magic for
each missile. Teleported projectiles have their accuracy greatly increased.
%%%%
Primal Wave spell

Conjures a torrent of water that may knock back the target, and creates a
pool of shallow water for a short duration.
%%%%
Pyroclastic Surge spell

Draws searing flames from lava. Any enemies of the caster standing
next to or above lava will be burned.
%%%%
Quicksilver Bolt spell

<Breathe Dispelling Energy ability>
%%%%
Repel Missiles spell

Reduces the chance of projectile attacks striking the caster, making them
easier to dodge. Single-target attacks are much easier to repel than
penetrating attacks.
%%%%
Resonance Strike spell

Calls a surge of power from the earth, striking an enemy within the caster's
sight. The spell cascades through nearby constructs, growing in strength with
each one standing near the target.
%%%%
Roll spell

Roll into a ball, granting the boulder beetle tremendous speed as well as
double melee damage. The roll may only be performed when at distance from a
foe, and the beetle will always unroll after an attempted roll attack.
%%%%
Sandblast spell

Blasts a target with high-velocity rock shards. Gathering the rock from ambient
grit is slow, making this spell take half again as long to cast as most. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sap Magic spell

Taints a targeted creature's ability to cast spells. Casting a spell while
afflicted with this condition causes the target to lose access to their magic,
briefly preventing them from casting any further spells.
%%%%
Scattershot spell

Blasts a cone-shaped area in front of the caster with metallic fragments. Its
damage is strongly reduced by armour.
%%%%
Scorch spell

Scorches a random foe. Those injured by this have their resistance to fire
burned away for a short time.
%%%%
Seal Doors spell

Imparts seals on nearby doors and stairs, preventing those not allied with
the caster from traversing them.
%%%%
Searing Ray spell

Fires a continuous piercing ray of arcane energy from the caster's hands. So
long as the caster maintains focus upon the spell and supplies it with magical
power (by waiting in place and not taking any other actions), the ray will
follow the caster's target if it should move.
%%%%
Searing Breath spell

Breathes a blast of fire at a targeted creature, leaving a cloud of flames at
the endpoint.
%%%%
Sentinel's Mark spell

Bestows a strong beacon upon a targeted creature. It announces the presence
and location of the marked creature to everyone on the same level.
%%%%
Seracfall spell

Violently collapses a nearby simulacrum into a large mass of ice, which
explodes on impact. The ice affects even cold-resistant creatures somewhat, due
to the strong impact and cutting edges.
%%%%
Shadow Bolt spell

Mimics a penetrating damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a
bolt of shadow.
%%%%
Shadow Creatures spell

Creates replicas of creatures native to the caster's current location, weaving
them from shadows and threads of Abyssal matter.
%%%%
Shadow Shard spell

Mimics a damaging spell cast by a Dithmenos worshipper, firing a shard of
shadow.
%%%%
Shatter spell

Causes an enormous burst of concussive force around the caster, dealing severe
damage to all nearby creatures. It is especially effective against those made
from ice, bone, or any wall-like substance (such as rock, metal or crystal), as
well as those turned to stone by petrification. It is less effective against
flying, gelatinous and insubstantial creatures. It may also destroy nearby
walls.
%%%%
Sheza's Dance spell

Summons weapons from far and wide - a dagger newly forged, a sword long-rusted
in a moldering tomb, an axe still steaming with the blood of its victim -
animating them and sending them out to attack.
%%%%
Shock spell

Throws a bouncing bolt of electricity. It partially bypasses armour.
%%%%
Silence spell

Eliminates all sound near the caster. This makes reading scrolls, casting
spells, invoking divine abilities, or shouting impossible in the caster's
vicinity. The spell's oppressive, unnatural effect will greatly hamper stealth.

Certain monsters have innate magical or special abilities which will still be
usable while silenced.

The effect starts out with a radius depending on power, which will then shrink,
eventually covering only the caster, before it times out.
%%%%
Simulacrum spell

Grips a creature's soul in chains of ice. When it dies, its corpse freezes and
splits, transforming into icy replicas which serve the caster. Simulacra cannot
leave the level they were created on. The number created depends on spell power.
%%%%
Siren Song spell

Sings a haunting song, making nearby victims unwilling to move away from the
singer. Leaving the caster's line of sight will end the effect.
%%%%
Sleep spell

Puts a targeted creature to sleep. Taking damage will typically wake the
target, and loud sounds can potentially do so as well.
%%%%
Slow spell

Slows the actions of a creature.
%%%%
Slug Dart spell

Fires a sharp dart of hardened chitin.
%%%%
Smiting spell

Smites any targeted enemy within sight, with no direct line of fire required.
%%%%
Spawn Tentacles spell

Extends large tentacles to attack nearby enemies.
%%%%
Spectral Cloud spell

Creates a cloud of spectral mist, dealing minor damage to all creatures other
than the undead. Dangerous but short-lived spectral undead creatures will
coalesce from the mist over time.
%%%%
Spellforged Servitor spell

Summons an extraplanar elemental and binds it to a durable shell forged from
the caster's own magic. The servitor is capable of unleashing some of the
destructive spells known to its creator, though the strongest and most volatile
of magics cannot be imbued in this fashion. The strength of the servitor
increases with spell power.
%%%%
Spider Form spell

Transforms the caster into a venomous, spider-like creature. The caster becomes
highly evasive and gains a poisonous bite, but gains vulnerability to poison.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded, and casting
spells becomes slightly more difficult.
%%%%
Spit Acid spell

Spits acid at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Lava spell

Spits lava at a targeted creature.
%%%%
Spit Poison spell

<Spit Poison ability>
%%%%
Splinterspray spell

Fires a directed stream of sharp wooden splinters. Its damage is strongly
reduced by armour.
%%%%
Sporulate spell

Releases a fast, gas-filled floating spore. After seeking out its foe, the
spore will explode, damaging anything caught in the blast and further confusing
living creatures.
%%%%
Sprint spell

Causes the caster to move across terrain more rapidly for a short duration.
%%%%
Starburst spell

Releases penetrating bolts of fire from the caster in every direction.
%%%%
Static Discharge spell

Releases electrical charges against those next to the caster. These may arc to
other adjacent creatures, or back to the caster, before eventually grounding
out. It deals reduced damage when arcing to the caster, and bypasses any armour
the target may have.
%%%%
Statue Form spell

Transforms the caster into a slow but extremely robust stone statue. The
caster's melee damage, both unarmed and with weapons, is substantially
increased. The caster's stone body is immune to poison and miasma, and gains
resistance to electricity and negative energy. High power increases the armour
granted by this form.

While transformed, any equipped body armour, gloves and boots are melded.
%%%%
Steam Ball spell

Throws a ball of hot steam towards a targeted creature.
%%%%
Sticky Flame Range spell

Launches a glob of sticky flame, covering a targeted creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Sticky Flame spell

Conjures a glob of sticky flame, covering an adjacent creature with liquid fire
for a short time.
%%%%
Still Winds spell

Brings the air into unnatural stillness across a huge area, preventing anything
short of a polar vortex from breaking the calm. The effect takes concentration
to maintain, and only lasts a short time; if the caster is killed, clouds will
begin to form again as normal.
%%%%
Sting spell

Briefly transforms one of the caster's limbs into a long insectoid stinger,
which lashes out at the target. The stinger's impact will always poison a
susceptible target. Even resistant targets have a chance to be poisoned and
immune monsters will be damaged by the physical impact of the stinger.
%%%%
Stoke Flames spell

Adds malice to hellish fires, binding it with flame into a creeping inferno.
%%%%
Stone Arrow spell

Fires a sharp spine of rock.
%%%%
Storm Form spell

Lets the caster walk through the air as a raging, lightning-filled tempest. The
caster's melee attacks are strengthened, electrified, and strike all adjacent
foes. The caster also flies, is more evasive, gains immunity to poison and
miasma, and resists electricity. They can launch themselves as a lightning
bolt, blasting through everything in their way. The damage and evasion granted
by storm form are highly dependent on the power with which it was cast.

While transformed, any equipped weapons and armour are melded.
%%%%
Strip Willpower spell

Greatly reduces the target's willpower, making them more vulnerable to a
variety of magical effects.
%%%%
Stunning Burst spell

Fires a weak electrical burst which, on impact, causes very brief paralysis.
Willpower is of no use against this effect, but resistance to electricity can
sometimes prevent it.
%%%%
Sublimation of Blood spell

Converts some of the caster's blood into magical energy. The process is painful
but never directly lethal. The efficiency of the conversion increases with the
spell's power.
%%%%
Summon Air Elementals spell

Summons one or more air elementals.
%%%%
Summon Cactus Giant spell

Summons a warrior from a particularly prickly tribe. Foes that strike these
giants in melee are in for a painful surprise! When cast at a higher power,
older, more robust warriors will answer the call.
%%%%
Summon Demon spell

Opens a gate to the realm of Pandemonium and draws forth one of its inhabitants
to serve the caster for a time.

Summon Forest spell

Forcefully intersects a forested plane with this world. It requires open space
to succeed. While the spell holds, a spirit of the forest will be called forth,
and the trees of the forest will be awakened to deal damage to nearby enemies.
Spell power increases the duration, size, and thickness of the intersected
plane; as well as the strength of the spirit.
%%%%
Summon Greater Demon spell

Calls forth one of the greater demons of Pandemonium to serve the caster.
%%%%
Summon Guardian Golem spell

Summons a protective golem. It redirects the injuries of its allies (but not
the caster) to itself. When sufficiently damaged, it may fill with an inner

%%%%

power.
%%%%
Summon Hydra spell

Summons a many-headed hydra to fight alongside the caster for a short time.
Spell power determines the number of heads.
%%%%
Summon Ice Beast spell

Calls forth a beast of ice to serve the caster. The strength of the beast

%%%%
Summon Illusion spell

Summons a temporary mirror image of an enemy. Such a copy has the same physical
prowess as the original, and can cast the same spells.
%%%%
Summon Lightning Spire spell

of electricity at the caster's foes, but is completely immobile. The strength
of the spire depends on spell power.
%%%%

painful.

%%%%
Throw Klown Pie spell

Throws a harmful yet strangely delicious pie that can inflict its victim with a
number of debilitating temporary effects. These include inducing vertigo,
silence, fire vulnerability, stat drain, or an aversion to drinking potions.
The dreaded moon pie can even turn you into a bat, a hog, or an insubstantial
wisp!
%%%%
Thunderbolt spell

Creates an arc of electricity.
%%%%
Tomb of Doroklohe spell

Entombs the caster within walls of rock. These walls will push away objects in

are not permanent, and will expire after a period of time.
%%%%
Trog's Hand spell

<Trog's Hand ability>
%%%%
Tukima's Dance spell

Animates the weapon of a targeted foe, ripping it from their hands and causing

the ground shortly thereafter.

Certain powerful named artefacts cannot be animated, and any properties that
require skill in evocations will not be active.
%%%%
Twisted Resurrection spell

Causes nearby corpses to begin crawling together, merging into horrible
agglomerations of flesh. More and larger corpses result in more powerful
creations.

%%%%
Volley of Thorns spell

Launches a small hail of sharp thorns.
%%%%

strength, but the wicked thorns they bear make their removal difficult. Such
brambles are sparse enough that almost any missile can pass through unhindered.
%%%%
Warning Cry spell

Generates a loud noise, alerting nearby enemies.
%%%%
Waterstrike spell

Causes the water around or under the target to violently swirl, dealing damage.
It can affect targets standing in or flying above water.

Weakening Gaze spell

Irresistably weakens a creature's melee attacks for a period of time,
requiring line of sight but not line of fire.
%%%%
Wereblood spell

Transforms some of the caster's blood into that of a were-beast, causing them
to occasionally howl uncontrollably. While active, each non-summoned enemy the
caster slays in combat temporarily enhances their melee and ranged
effectiveness, and killing adjacent enemies also provides minor healing.

The bonus only lasts for the duration of a single cast; retransforming the
caster's blood calms the were-spirit and resets the bonus.
%%%%
Wind Blast spell

Causes a strong gust of wind, pushing away creatures and clouds in a cone.
%%%%
Woodweal spell

Draws on the vitality of leaf and bark to heal a large amount of damage.
Cannot be cast without a tree adjacent.

Yara's Violent Unravelling spell

If cast upon a creature already blessed (or cursed) with magical enchantments,
those enchantments will be torn apart, transforming into a spray of
destructive mutagenic radiation. The victim and anyone adjacent will be
blasted and heavily deformed, weakening them and reducing their armour.
Summoned creatures are particularly vulnerable, as the enchantments binding
them to this plane will unravel and cause them to be dismissed immediately.
